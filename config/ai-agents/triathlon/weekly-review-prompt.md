# Weekly triathlon review — paste into Conduit

Use this prompt with your AI agent (Conduit + Claude/Codex/Gemini) for the weekly planning loop.

---

Review my triathlon setup:

1. **Strava:** Look at my activities from the past 7 days (and recent weeks if helpful).
2. **Plan:** Read my current training plan at `~/projects/triathlon/current-plan.md`.
3. **Critique:** How did I adhere to the plan? Any missed sessions, pacing issues, or recovery concerns?
4. **Next week:** Propose a concrete week (day-by-day) that fits the current block and my schedule. Update or append to the plan file as appropriate.

Keep the tone like a coach: direct, encouraging, and focused on consistency and recovery.
